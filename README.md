VPS 1Core 1Gb Wordpress
=========================

This script sets up LEMP Stack on Ubuntu (14.04x64) with Nginx, MySql 5.5, PHP-FPM 5.5, phpMyAdmin


Optimized for 1 Core - 1024 MB, more finetuning can of course always be made, microcaching and gzip will be more tuned in next release.

Not much comments in script, will fill that in later so bear with me ;)

All suggestions are welcome / Andr√© - Nadox // aj@nadox.se

Quick Setup:


Login to the Ubuntu Server 14.04.1 LTS VPS you have created, then just run:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajnadox/VPS_core11gbMem_wordpress/master/VPS_LEMP_ndx.sh && sudo chmod +x VPS_LEMP_ndx.sh && sudo ./VPS_LEMP_ndx.sh`
